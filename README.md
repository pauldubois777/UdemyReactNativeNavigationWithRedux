## Udemy React-Native course code example

### Navigation and Redux

This Repo is for the "Meals" mobile-app that I am creating for a Udemy course.

The Udemy course is [React Native - The Practical Guided 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide)

I am not using "Expo CLI" for my development, but rather I created the app using the React CLI.

All the code in the `src` folder is almost entirely written by me from scratch - it isn't just copied from the course examples.

The code in this repo was written for the sections dealing with Navigation and Redux (state management)

Please keep in mind that this code was written only for this section in the course, and doesn't always represent my best coding efforts, or a completed application.

On the other hand, I always go beyond the course examples and try to code in a re-usable and well-engineered way.

I also did not put a lot time/effort into design (colors, fonts, branding, etc), but rather focussed on the fundamentals of the section topics.

### My Notes:
